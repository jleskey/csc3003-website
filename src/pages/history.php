        <p>
            Our earliest founders, regrettably, failed to record our ealiest history. Acccording to
            legend, however, our our brand was forged in the creative fervor of the Bithagen
            community over forty years ago. Accounts differ as to the founding members of our small
            company, but we know for sure that celebrated game developer Prudence Gnuford and
            world famous author and filmmaker Sigurd Inta were among their number. Mr. Inta served
            in several executive positions and mentioned us most favorably in his manifesto before
            he went to live in the woods as a true naturalist. Ms. Gnuford still serves today as
            the chair for our board of directors. We have asked her many times for a more complete
            account of our history, but she maintains that she is not at liberty to say.
        </p>
        <p>
            Legendary or not, to this day we stay true to our roots and look forward to many more
            years of relentlessly doing what we do, helping to bring stories into the world.
